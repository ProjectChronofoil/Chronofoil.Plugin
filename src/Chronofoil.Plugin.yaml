description: |-
  Chronofoil is a plugin that allows you to capture in-game packets for analysis later.
  It also allows you to upload a censored version of these captures to a central repository for
  preservation and analysis. Privacy controls are at the center of Chronofoil, which is why it
  requires two levels of user opt-in, has minimum delays on releasing any submitted user info,
  and allows users to delete their submitted data at any time.
